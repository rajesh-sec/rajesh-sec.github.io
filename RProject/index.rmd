# What is a Penetration Test?

*A penetration test consists in testing the security of an information system by carrying out attacks in order to identify system vulnerabilities and to recommend security corrections.*

## Penetration Test Methodology
*A penetration test is based on a four-phase methodology, which is a cyclic process: Recon, Mapping, Discovery, Exploitation.*

1. Recon
   + The recon phase consists in searching for open-source information on the target of the security audit. All information potentially useful for an attacker is collected, for example: IP addresses, domain and sub-domain names, types and versions of technologies used, technical information shared on forums or social networks, data leaks…

2. Mapping
    + The mapping phase allows listing all functionalities of the audit target. This step enables pentesters to have a better visibility on the most critical and exposed elements. This step is particularly essential when the objective of the security audit is to conduct tests on all the functionalities of a target.

3. Discovery
    + The discovery phase is an attack phase: pentesters look for vulnerabilities through manual searches complemented by automated tools. The objective is to discover as many vulnerabilities as possible on the target.

4. Exploitation
    + The exploitation phase consists in testing possible exploitations of the flaws identified in the previous phase. This step allows using certain flaws as “pivots”, in order to discover new vulnerabilities. The exploitation of security vulnerabilities allows evaluating their real impact and thus their criticality level.
